# Social Media Analysis Report (Power BI)

This repository contains an analysis of the organization's social media performance, focusing on Facebook and LinkedIn platforms. **The report provides detailed insights into audience behaviour, content interactions, and overall performance over the past year (2024)**. Key findings and recommendations are shared to help enhance the effectiveness of social media strategies.

***All data that could lead to the identification of the client was removed. This includes the company’s logo, visuals of posted content, the company name, and the names of its programs.***

The analysis and visualizations were created using **Power BI**. However, since the client was not familiar with the platform and requested a PDF file, the Power BI dashboards were exported as PDF after completion. This approach influenced design decisions:  
- Some text that would normally be placed in tooltips was written in text boxes.  
- Interactive filtering was not used, focusing instead on a static design.

- **Video Content**: Videos have lower engagement and require strategic planning to justify the investment.

## Recommendations

- **Increase Posting Frequency**: Aim for 1-2 posts per day on Facebook and 3-5 posts per week on LinkedIn.
- **Optimize Video Strategy**: Focus on short, engaging videos used selectively for high-impact promotions.
- **Use Interactive Tools**: Utilize polls, Facebook Stories, and calls to action to increase engagement.
- **Ad Strategy**: Focus ads on clear calls to action (CTAs) for better results.
